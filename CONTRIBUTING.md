# Style Guide

It helps to read code if it is written in a consistent style. Therefore contributors should agree to and adhere to a style guide (anything in fact, just keep it consistent), instead of wasting time to reformat codebase back and forth.

And don't waste too much time on formatting. Pure style contributions are welcome only if they fix inconsistencies.

## Localization files (.yml)

- indent 1 space
- optional zero/one/etc. after column (paradox does that but it breaks yaml syntax highlight)
